# Summer-2015-Pivot-Algorithm
Implementation of the Pivot Algorithm on small length 2D walks

Current State: Needs Debugging

Self Avoiding Polygons have been studied by people for over 50 years now.
My attempt was to create simulations of 12 and 14 edged Self Avoiding polygon and
write a code that randomly generates various polygons(uniquely) using the pivot algorithm.

I started this in Summer 2015, and it seemed to be working fine, before I wanted to do more
complicated stuff and messed it all up.

Currently working on debugging this in my free time. The 115 times file should tell you what I had before I messed it up.
